ID_ME_DE_ORANGEGEAR_MAKEGOOD_202009,Fix Incoming
ID_ME_BO_ORANGEGEAR_MAKEGOOD_202009,"Commander,\n\nOver the weekend, there was an issue with the Orange Catalyst Orb where some players received 3,000 orbs from the Valuable Lessons Calendar. The Dev team resolved the mistake with the orb quickly and is currently working on next steps to make a correction to the players' accounts who may have opened any of those incorrectly granted orbs, and made use of the resources. This correction will not impact players who did not erroneously receive these orbs. As a part of the correction, we will be taking the game down for a period of time later in the week.\n\nWe understand reverting gear progress is extremely frustrating and it's not something we take lightly, but the severity of our mistake is such that we can't let affected players keep their progress, nor can we make the incorrect amounts available to everyone. After the correction goes into effect, we'll be sending out two forms of compensation:\n\n- To the players directly affected by the correction: you'll receive a compensation package for the resources and time invested, as well as the inconvenience we've caused.\n\n- To all other players: a compensation package to alleviate the competitive advantage that other players gained between the time the bug went live and the corrections and the general inconvenience that this issue has caused you as well.\n\nWe apologize for our mistake, and thank you for your patience."
